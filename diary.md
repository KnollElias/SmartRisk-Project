What started as an experiment with the pure expectation that prices of deflationary markets will go up indefinetely and more so that they go down/time turned into a fabilous Chain of findings.

THe realistaion that trading based on time is very expensive and risky move me to get into DCA Robots. Currently i am running expereince on hte Pionex exchange with socalled DCA-Bots.

THe priciple is to have some martingale dca strategy with safety orders where a scale can be defined. THe configurable parameters are:
- scale share
- scale pricegap
- scale level count

26.02.2025: to few level counts can lead to beeing out of range of the scale and not doing nay transction and keeping a unrealized loss

15.04.2025: to small scale leveel pricegaps foucks you up as well

03.05.2025: to big price gaps are not closign any rounds, ssmaller is better but hte average price should be close to the ask price, because the gap betweeen then average buy price and hte acutal price is to keep as small as possible, while not having to much capital, so total risk should be not to much ten the first share
